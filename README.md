# Gender-Friendly-Analysis-for-News-Platforms
## Introduction
This project focuses on creating a tool for analyzing the gender-friendliness of news platforms. With the widespread accessibility of media, individuals are constantly exposed to various media channels, often absorbing the values conveyed by mainstream society. Media can emphasize or delete specific information through simple text and video editing techniques, gradually undermining individuals' ability to think independently and interpret media. Despite the undeniable influence of media in today's society, we often observe gender-unfriendly phenomena across different media platforms.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to promote a more gender-friendly development of news media in Taiwan. By delivering objective and neutral information, people can choose news platforms that align with their values, thereby enhancing the overall willingness of Taiwanese people to use news platforms. To achieve this, historical articles from various news outlets are collected as a basis for analysis, quantifying the gender-friendliness and helping the public better understand the gender-friendliness of each media outlet.

## Project Content
This project primarily consists of Python scripts for web scraping news data and utilizing the Google Natural Language API for sentiment analysis. Based on the word choices and content of historical news data, quantified scores are assigned to evaluate the gender-friendliness of each news outlet. Recommendations and improvement methods are provided for different news organizations based on their current status and pain points, aiming to enhance the overall gender-friendliness of Taiwan's news media environment.

## Solution
The analysis results are used to calculate scores and create rankings, enabling users to choose the most suitable and preferred news platforms as their primary sources of information. According to survey results, the gender-friendliness of media significantly affects people's willingness to use them and their emotional state. Therefore, news outlets with lower rankings must improve and correct their content to attract more viewers. Suggestions for improvement will be provided for news organizations with lower gender-friendliness scores, facilitating the progress of the entire news industry towards gender-friendliness.

## Implementation
Programming Language: Python
